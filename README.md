# LaserCuttingCompany

It's a small automatic rele, which helps to spare pressed air and electricity. The input signal goes through the optocoupler thus there is no galvanic connection between the PLC of the laser cutting machine and electronic relay. The input current amounts to about 2-3 mA. The input connectors are +24, 'Wind' signal and GND. If a low level appears on the Wind-contact the air valve goes open and the appropriate compressor is switched on. If the input signal become high the 5 sec. delay is started, after that the air valve is closed and the compressor is switched off.
